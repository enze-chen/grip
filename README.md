# GRand canonical Interface Predictor (GRIP)

_Authors: [Enze Chen](https://enze-chen.github.io/) (Stanford University) and
[Timofey Frolov](https://people.llnl.gov/frolov2) (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory)_     
_Version: 0.2025.04.12_

An algorithm for performing grand canonical optimization (GCO) of interfacial
structure (e.g., grain boundaries) in crystalline materials.
It automates sampling of slab translations and reconstructions
along with vacancy generation and finite temperature molecular dynamics (MD).
The algorithm repeatedly samples different structures in two phases:
  1. Structure generation and manipulation is largely handled using the
  [Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/).
  2. Molecular dynamics and static relaxations are currently performed using
  [LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org), although in principle other energy
  evaluation methods (e.g., density functional theory in [VASP](https://www.vasp.at))
  may be used.

Video tutorials for some of the capabilities and usage patterns can be found on YouTube in our [2025 TMS presentation](https://youtu.be/QtuUdnOl1k4) and [command line examples](https://youtu.be/5BwtWnQ-JR8). ðŸŽ¥

## Dependencies
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (3.6+)
- [PyYAML](https://pyyaml.org/) (6.0)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) (1.23.0)
- [ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) (3.22.1)
- [LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org) (stable, **serial** binary only)
- [MPI for Python](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable) (for PBS resource managers only)

_Optional_
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) (1.5.3)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html) (3.5.3)


## Usage

GRIP functions as a collection of scripts, there's no binary that you need to install or compile.
Assuming the above Python libraries are installed, clone the repo and make the 
appropriate modifications in `params.yaml` (see file for detailed comments), 
including the path to the LAMMPS binary on your system.
If you wish, you can supply your own slabs for the bicrystal configuration as
POSCAR_LOWER and POSCAR_UPPER (in the [POSCAR](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/POSCAR)
file format).
Then call:
```python
python main.py
```
If you don't have LAMMPS or just want to test the script, you can run it with the `-d` flag.
See the `.examples` folder for a SLURM submission script for parallel execution (preferred).
Note that GRIP can use multiple cores, but only those on a single node.


## File structure
- `main.py`: Script to launch everything.
- `params.yaml`: Simulation parameters; **you'll want to edit this.**
- `core`: Main classes (`Bicrystal`, `Simulation`, etc.)
- `utility`: Main helper functions (`utils.py`, `unique.py`, etc.)
- `simul_files`: Files for simulations (LAMMPS input files, etc.)
- `best`: All relaxed structures are stored here. The naming convention is:
`lammps_Egb_n_X-SHIFT_Y-SHIFT_X-REPS_Y-REPS_TEMP_STEPS`


Duplicate files are periodically deleted by calling `clear_best()` in `utils/unique.py`.
The default method cleans about 1-3% of files on average.
Use the `-e` flag for more aggressive cleaning (>50%).
Use the `-s` flag to save the processed results to CSV from a pandas DataFrame.

Results can be visualized by running `python utils/plot_gco.py` and it generates a 
GCO plot of $E_{\mathrm{gb}}$ vs. $[n]$.
The `.examples` folder has this plot for several boundaries.
By default executing this file will save both the results (CSV) and the figure (PNG) 
to the same folder as the GRIP output files.

## Areas for improvement
- [x] Add parallelism for other job schedulers besides SLURM.
- [ ] Create more flexible workflow classes for Monte Carlo moves, energy minimization options, etc.
- [ ] Extend the code to be compatible with the parallel build of LAMMPS.
- [ ] Extend the code to work on cores across multiple compute nodes.
- [ ] Extend the compositional DOF to work with multi-component systems.
- [ ] Add in Bayesian optimization to narrow down simulation parameters.
- [ ] Incorporate ways to identify the GB atoms on the fly.
- [ ] Optimize the saving of files to reduce the memory footprint (sometimes > 1 GB).
- [ ] Improve the error handling if LAMMPS crashes (and resubmit?)
